One of my friend asked me to create a basic blackjack odd calculator so that he could
always know if it's rather worth hitting another card or standing instead of always watching
the odds table available online. He also wanted to have the possibility to add several user to the same table.
The interface is really messed up, I'm bad at making things beautiful, but it's working very well.
You can also customize the amount of decks that are in play and reshuffle and some other
options like that.
